On the Map is an iOS application, written in Swift, that shows information posted by other students. The map will contain pins that show the location where other students have reported studying.

## Installation

## Usage

Users will be able to configure the application to retrieve and display content from the Pare API. By tapping on the pin users can see a URL for something the student finds interesting. The user will be able to add their own data by posting a string that can be reverse geocoded to a location, and a URL.
